# fastify-oas

[OpenAPI 3.0+ (OAS3)](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) documentation generator for Fastify.
It uses the schemas you declare in your routes to generate a swagger compliant doc.

This plugin based on [fastify-swagger](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger/) that generates swagger 2.0 spec.

This plugin designed in such way to be compatible with it's predcessor and in most cases if you already use `fastify-swagger` you may just replace it with current plugin and it should work.
